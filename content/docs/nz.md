# Regulation of AI in New Zealand

The approach of the New Zealand Government is to progressively incorporate regulation of AI into existing legislation and regulations, rather than developing new AI-specific regulations and legislation. 

New Zealand has an [ICT Operations Assurance Framework](https://www.digital.govt.nz/dmsdocument/129-aog-ict-operations-assurance-framework/html).
They define assurance as "an independent and objective assessment that provides credible information to support decision-making", 
and list six principles of good assurance:
* Assurance by design
* Flexible
* Informs key decisions
* Risk and outcomes based
* Independent and impartial
* Accountability

The New Zealand government also provide 
[guidance and templates for ICT operations assurance](https://www.digital.govt.nz/standards-and-guidance/governance/system-assurance/all-of-government-ict-operations-assurance-framework/guidance-and-templates-for-ict-operations-assurance/),
 consisting of the following steps:
1. Managing your ICT (Information and Communications Technology) risks
2. Developing your assurance plan
3. Maximizing the value of independent assurance
4. Ensuring high quality assurance information
5. Overseeing assurance activities and recommendations
6. Capturing lessons learned
