## High-Level Expert Group on AI – Ethics Guidelines for trustworthy AI
The European Commission’s High-Level Expert Group on AI published [Ethics Guidelines for trustworthy AI](https://www.aepd.es/sites/default/files/2019-12/ai-ethics-guidelines.pdf) in 2019. It introduces three necessary (but not sufficient) components for achievement of trustworthy AI, that should be met throughout the AI system's entire life cycle, namely that it should be **lawful**, **ethical** and **robust**. The guideline present a framework addressing the ethics and robustness aspects.

Chapter I (Foundations of Trustworthy AI) identifies the ethical principles and their correlated values that must be respected in the development, deployment and use of AI systems. Key ethical principles include **respect for human autonomy**, **prevention of harm**, **fairness** and **explicability**. 
Chapter II (Realising Trustworthy AI) provides guidance on how Trustworthy AI can be realised, by listing seven requirements that AI systems should meet:

1.	 human agency and oversight;
2.	technical robustness and safety;
3.	privacy and data governance;
4.	transparency;
5.	diversity, non-discrimination and fairness;
6.	environmental and societal well-being, and;
7.	accountability.

Chapter III (Assessing Trustworthy AI) provides a concrete and non-exhaustive Trustworthy AI assessment list aimed at operationalising the key requirements set out in Chapter II.
